		<h1>Sporty Places is the marketplace for schools and personal trainers</h1>
			<h2>If you're a school</h2>
				<p>With recent budget cuts, you need to find ways to raise more funds, and your sports halls are sitting unused outside of school hours. It's hard to find the person willing to pay for it all of the time</p>
			<h2>If you're a personal trainer</h2>
				<p>You know how hard it is to find the right venue, in the right location at the right price</p>
			<h2>Sporty Places brings it together</h2>
				<p>Sporty Places helps schools find sports organisers, and personal trainers to find venues for their classes</p>
